title: Teleport Core Concepts
description: Learn the the key architectural components that make up Teleport.
---

Here are the core concepts that make up a Teleport deployment. You will see
these terms often when setting up and managing Teleport, so you should get
familiar with them before following other pages in the documentation.

## Authentication connector

An authentication connector is a **configuration resource** that allows users to
authenticate to Teleport via a Single Sign-On (SSO) solution. 

See our guide to [Authentication Options](./reference/authentication.mdx).

## Certificate authority

Teleport allows services and clients to achieve secure access using SSH and TLS
certificates. 

The components of a **Teleport Cluster**, such as clients and **Teleport
Services**, use these certificates to verify that they are connecting with a
genuine Teleport Service or user. To do so, they check that the certificate was
signed by a **certificate authority**—an entity that issues certificates—that
belongs to your Teleport Cluster. 

The **Teleport Auth Service** includes multiple certificate authorities, which
it uses for different purposes.

Read about how Teleport's certificate authorities work in our [Auth Service
architecture guide](./architecture/authentication.mdx).

## Configuration resource

A **configuration resource** is a document stored on the **Auth Service**
backend that specifies settings for your **Teleport cluster**. Examples include
**roles**, **local users**, and **authentication connectors**

Read more in our [Resource Reference](./reference/resources.mdx).

## Machine ID

Machine ID is a service that automatically provisions credentials for **bot
users**, which can use these credentials to connect automatically to resources
in your infrastructure. Machine ID runs via the `tbot` binary.

Read more in our [Machine ID guide](./machine-id/introduction.mdx).

## Role

A **role** is a **configuration resource** that grants **Teleport users**
privileges within a cluster. Teleport's role-based access control (RBAC) is
restrictive by default, and a user needs explicit permissions before they can
access a resource or perform management tasks on a cluster.

Read our [guide to Teleport roles](./access-controls/guides/role-templates.mdx).

## Teleport Auth Service

The **Teleport Auth Service** manages **certificate authorities**, **local
users**, and **configuration resources** within a **Teleport cluster**. It uses
storage backends and—if configured—a hardware security module to store the
certificate authorities' private keys. The Auth Service issues certificates to
clients and maintains an audit log.

The Auth Service is the only service that has to be connected to a backend. All
other services are stateless and interact with the Auth Service via a gRPC API.
**Teleport Services** can connect to the Auth Service either directly or via a
reverse tunnel established by the **Proxy Service**. This means that you can run
Teleport Services and the Auth Service in a private network, with only the Proxy
Service's HTTPS port exposed to the internet.

You can run multiple Auth Service instances in a cluster for high availability.

Read our guides to how [authorization](./architecture/authorization.mdx) and
[authentication](./architecture/authentication.mdx) work in Teleport.

## Teleport Cloud

**Teleport Cloud** is a managed deployment of the **Teleport Control Plane**.
Our team at Teleport handles all tasks related to running the **Auth Service**
and **Proxy Service**, including upgrades and certificate management. Each
customer account, known as a **Teleport Cloud tenant**, has its own subdomain of
`.teleport.sh`, e.g., `mytenant.teleport.sh`.

Read more in our [Teleport Cloud
guide](./deploy-a-cluster/teleport-cloud/introduction.mdx).

## Teleport Cluster

The key concept of Teleport's architecture is the **cluster**. A Teleport
cluster consists of the **Teleport Auth Service** and **Teleport Proxy Service**,
plus several **Teleport Services** that manage traffic to resources within your
infrastructure, such as Kubernetes clusters and Windows desktops. A Teleport
cluster also includes **Machine ID** and **Teleport Discover**.

A minimal Teleport Cluster consists of the Teleport Auth Service and Teleport
Proxy Service. In a demo environment, you can run these two services from a
single **Teleport Process**.

## Teleport Control Plane

The Control Plane consists of the **Auth Service** and **Proxy Service**, which
govern cluster-wide access. Other **Teleport Services**, which ensure access to
specific resources, are not considered part of the Teleport Control Plane.

## Teleport Enterprise

**Teleport Enterprise** is a paid plan that includes additional features for the
**Teleport Control Plane** and **Teleport Services**, plus a support agreement
with Teleport.

Read more in our [Teleport Enterprise
guide](./deploy-a-cluster/teleport-enterprise/introduction.mdx).

## Teleport Process

A single running `teleport` binary is called a **Teleport Process**. A Teleport
Process can run one or more **Teleport Services**, depending on the user's
configuration. 

Read about all subcommands of `teleport` in our [CLI
Reference](./reference/cli.mdx#teleport).

## Teleport Proxy Service

The **Teleport Proxy Service** allows for secure access to resources in a
**Teleport Cluster** from the public internet without the need for a VPN. 

It establishes reverse tunnels to **Teleport Services**, including the
**Teleport Auth Service**, which can run in private networks. This means that,
in the Proxy Service's minimal configuration, you can expose only port `443` to
the internet and run the rest of your infrastructure in private networks.

You can also configure clients to bypass Proxy Service instances and connect to
resources with Teleport-issued certificates directly. 

Read our guide to [how the Teleport Proxy Service
works](./architecture/proxy.mdx).

## Teleport Service

A **Teleport Service** manages access to resources in your infrastructure, such
as Kubernetes clusters, Windows desktops, internal web applications, and
databases. All Teleport Services can run from a single **Teleport Process**, as
can the **Auth Service** and **Proxy Service**:

|Service|Traffic it Proxies|
|---|---|
|[Teleport Database Service](./database-access/introduction.mdx)|TCP traffic in the native protocols of popular databases, including PostgreSQL and MySQL.|
|[Teleport Application Service](./application-access/introduction.mdx)|HTTP and TCP traffic to user-configured endpoints, e.g., internal web applications or the AWS Console.|
|[Teleport Desktop Service](./desktop-access/introduction.mdx)|Remote Desktop Protocol traffic to Windows desktops.|
|[Teleport Kubernetes Service](./kubernetes-access/introduction.mdx)|HTTP traffic to the Kubernetes API server.|
|[Teleport Node Service](./server-access/introduction.mdx)|Remote shell command execution via an SSH server implementation. Machines you can access via this service are called **Teleport Nodes**.|
|Teleport Discovery Service|Uses external APIs, such as a regional AWS API, to discover resources in your infrastructure so users can access them via Teleport.|

## Teleport users

Teleport allows for three kinds of user:

- **Local users** correspond to a `user` **configuration resource** stored on
  the **Auth Service** backend.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO) Users** are stored on the backend of your SSO solution,
  e.g., Okta or GitHub. When a user authenticates to Teleport via your SSO
  solution, Teleport issues a certificate for the user and creates a temporary
  **local user** that is valid for the lifetime of the certificate.
- **Bot users** are automated services that receive credentials via **Machine ID**.
  The **Auth Service** issues these credentials for a bot user, which you can
  assign **Teleport roles** like any other user.

Ultimately, a Teleport user is the subject of a certificate issued by the
Teleport Auth Service. The Auth Service verifies that a client or service
attempting to connect has a valid Teleport-issued certificate. It then uses the
subject of the certificate—including its username and Teleport roles—to
authorize the user.  

Read more about [local users](./reference/authentication.mdx) and how [SSO
authentication works in Teleport](./access-controls/sso.mdx).

## Trusted Cluster

A **Trusted Cluster** is a remote **Teleport Cluster** joined to your own
Cluster via a trust relationship. Users in your Teleport Cluster can access
resources in a Trusted Cluster.

In a Trusted Cluster relationship, the remote cluster is called a **leaf
cluster**. Your cluster, if you are adding a leaf cluster to it, is called a
**root cluster**. 

To establish trust, an operator of the root cluster generates a token, and an
operator of the leaf cluster uses that token to add the Trusted Cluster. Users
within the root cluster can then access resources in the leaf cluster.

Read our [Trusted Clusters architecture
guide](./architecture/trustedclusters.mdx) for how Trusted Clusters work and our
[how-to guide](./management/admin/trustedclusters.mdx) for how to configure
Trusted Clusters.
